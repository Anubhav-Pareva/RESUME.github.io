	<h2>What Is Programming ?</h2>
	<img src="images\whatispro.png">
	<p>Programming basically means that you provide the computer a set of instruction that are written in a language that the computer can understand. The instruction could be of various type. Just like we humans can understand a few languages like English, Spanish, French, etc. So is the case with computers. Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language</p></div>

	<h3>ANSI C</h3>
	<a href="c.html"><img src="images\c.jpg"></a>
	<p>'C' seems a strange name for a programming language. But this strange sounding language is one of the most popular computer languages today because it is a structured, high-level, machine independent language. It allows software developers to develop programs without worrying about the hardware platforms where they will be implemented. C was evolved by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.</p>

	<h3>C++</h3>
	<a href="c++.html"><img src="images\cplus.jpg"></a>
	<p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA, in the early 1980's. Stroustrup, an admirer of Simula67 and a strong supporter of C, wanted to combine the best of both the languages and create a more powerful language that could support object-oriented programming features and still retain the power and elegance of C.</p>

	<h3>JAVA</h3>
	<a href="java.html"><img src="images\javap.jpg"></a>
	<p>JAVA is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems of USA in 1991. Originally called Oak by James Gosling, one of the inventors of the language. JAVA is a computer language which is purely object-oriented. JAVA's designers have borrowed the best features of many existing languages such as C and C++ and added a few new features to form a simple, easy-to-learn, complete, secure and object-oriented programming language.</p>
